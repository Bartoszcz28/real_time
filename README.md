# Real-Time Data Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze data in real-time. Data is randomly generated by the Jupyter container and sent using Apache Kafka to the PostgreSQL container, where it is stored and made available for further analysis.

# Containers
## 1. zookeeper
Container containing Apache ZooKeeper, necessary for managing the Apache Kafka cluster infrastructure.

## 2. postgres
Container with PostgreSQL database, used for storing the real-time generated data.

## 3. broker
Container with Apache Kafka, responsible for transmitting data between different project components.

## 4. dashboard
Container with an interactive dashboard based on Plotly Dash, enabling visualization and monitoring of data from the PostgreSQL database.

## 5. flash
Container with an API interface (e.g., based on Flask), allowing access to PostgreSQL data by external applications.

## 6. jupyter
Container with a Jupyter Notebook environment, generating random data and sending it to Apache Kafka for further processing and analysis.
